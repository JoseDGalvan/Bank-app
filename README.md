# Bank-app

In this project, I developed an API / REST in Laravel for a banking application 
that allows users to make money transfers easily and securely. To fulfill this 
functionality, several important features were implemented. First, users were allowed 
to create an account by providing information such as full name, cedula and email. 
Then, a bank account was created with an initial balance of 0, allowing users to make
deposits into their account.

To make transfers to other accounts, users can provide information about the destination 
account and the amount to be transferred. In addition, the application allows users to view 
their account movement history and the list of accounts associated with their profile, along 
with their respective balances. Finally, the functionality to obtain the total balance 
of a user's accounts was included, providing an overview of the user's financial status.

This project demonstrates my skills in web application development using Laravel and my 
ability to create solutions that meet user needs and provide a secure and user-friendly experience.
